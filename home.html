layout: false

## About Angular

- AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.

- It all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.

- Data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you currently have to write. 

- Encourages the creation of very maintainable and modular code

- It doesnt treat testing as an afterthought

---

## Alternatives

Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. 

Neither of these address the root problem that **HTML was not designed for dynamic views.**

![Angularjs](src/backbone.png)

## Backbone?

- large and passionate community

- is minimal and unopinionated

- But requires a lot of boilerplate code to make it work well

- It is *really* just a pattern for structuring your code.

- Still requires heavy DOM manipulation

---

![Angularjs](src/ember.png)

## Ember?

- Also supports two-way binding

- Huge filesize ~250kb

- Big learning curve to get productive

- Requires heavy `data-` attr binding to work

- Lack of community support and documentation

---

![Angularjs](src/knockout.png)

## Knockout?

- Easy to learn, fantastic tutorials

- Requires additional libraries for routing, UI components etc

- Hard to use templating system, awkward binding syntax

- No isolated contexts, very easy to created a convoluted codebase

---

![Angularjs](src/jquery.png)

- Has a very low barrier to entry

- But will most likely lead to Spagetti code :(

![angualr](src/AOP-Spring-image001.png)

- Requires heavy, often convoluted DOM manipulation to work

---

## Interest in AngularJS overtime

Whilst trends don't indicate a whole lot, it does give you an idea of just how much of an impact AngularJS is starting to make on the dynamic web as we know it.

# The Basics

---

# Data binding

It is easily one of the most powerful parts on AngularJS

Data-binding is an automatic way of updating the view whenever the model changes, or the model when the view changes.

&nbsp;

    ![Angularjs](src/One_Way_Data_Binding.png)
]
.right-column[
    ![Angularjs](src/Two_Way_Data_Binding.png)
]

---

## Data binding demo

```javascript
<div ng-app>
    <label>Name:</label>
    <input type="text" ng-model="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here" />
    <hr>
    <h1>Hello {{yourName}}!</h1>
</div>
```
<div class="demo" id="demo1">
    <div ng-app>
        <label>Name:</label>
        <input type="text" ng-model="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here" />
        <hr>
        <h1>Hello {{yourName}}!</h1>
    </div>
</div>

---

# Directives

- Markers on a DOM element (attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) 

- They tell AngularJS's HTML compiler to attach a behavior or transform that specific DOM element.

- AngularJS has some build in directives (`ngModel`, `ngView`, `ngClick` etc).

- You can also create your own directives for Angular to use.

- Completely reusable

---
## This is a directive

```javascript
<script>
app.directive('helloWorld', function () {
    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        scope:{ name:'@' },
        template: '<span>Hello {{name}}</span>'
    }
});
</script>

<hello-world name="Bruce Wayne"></hello-world>
```
## which generates this html

```html
<span>Hello Bruce Wayne</span>
```

---
## Directive properties

A few key properties that you may come across and an example of using them:

```javascript
angular.module('moduleName')
    .directive('myDirective', function () {
    return {
        restrict: 'EA', 
        //E = element, A = attribute, C = class, M = comment         
        scope: {
            //@ reads the attribute value
            //= provides two-way binding
            //&amp; works with functions
            title: '@'         },
        template: '<div>{{ myVal }}</div>',
        templateUrl: 'mytemplate.html',
        controller: controllerFunction, //Embed custom controller in directive
        link: function ($scope, element, attrs) { } //DOM manipulation
    }
});
```

---

# Controllers

Use controllers to:

- Set up the initial state of the `$scope` object.
- Add behavior to the `$scope` object.

Do not use controllers to:

- Manipulate DOM — Controllers should contain only business logic. (No presentation logic)
- Filter/manipulate output — Use `Filters` instead.
- Share code or state across controllers — Use `Services` instead.
- Manage the life-cycle of other components (for example, to create service instances).

Not following these rules will impact testability of your code

---

## Controller example

```javascript
app.controller('AppController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    $scope.liked = false;
    $scope.like = function() {
        $scope.liked = true;
    };
}]);
```
```html
<div ng-controller="AppController">
    <button ng-click="like()">{{liked ? 'unlike' : 'like'}}</button>
    <p>You {{like ? '': 'dont'}} like this</p>
</div>
```

<iframe class="demo" src="demos/controller.html" height="130"></iframe>

---

# Filters

A filter formats a value for display to the user. 

They can be used in view templates, controllers or services and it is easy to write your own filter.

```javascript
{{ expression | filter }}
```

As an example `{{ 1234 | number:2 }}` will filter the number 1234 with the Angular `number` filter.

The outcome would be `1,234.00`

---

## Filter demo

```javascript
app.filter('reverse', function() {
    return function(input) {
        return input.split('').reverse().join('');
    };
});
```

```html
<input type="text" ng-model="text" placeholder="Enter text"/>
<p>Input: {{ text }}</p>
<p>Filtered input: {{ text | reverse }}</p>
```

<iframe class="demo" src="demos/filter.html" height="170"></iframe>

# Getting past the Angular learning curve

---
class: center, middle

![Angularjs](src/feelings_about_angularjs_over_time.png)

---

## The learning curve

- Angular.js has a very different learning curve from some of the other frameworks. (ex backbone)

- You don’t **need** to understand all core concepts like `modules`, `services`, `dependency injection`, `scope` etc.

- Controllers and some directives can get you started.

- However once you start to get serious, the learning curve suddenly becomes very steep

???

ex. Backbone.js has a steep learning curve up front: to write a simplest app, you need to know pretty much everything about it.

After you have nailed it, there is pretty much nothing other than some common building blocks and best practices.

Angular.js - You don’t **need** to understand all core concepts.

The problem is when you start to write a serious app, the learning curve suddenly becomes very steep.

It took quite some time to get over this stage and start to benefit from its potential.

# Thinking in Angular
### Imperative → declarative

&nbsp;

"AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used for building user interfaces, while imperative programming is excellent for expressing business logic."

- **Imperative** You explicity tell the machine what you want under specific circumstances, wrapped into an `if` statement for example

- **Declarative** You declare how to display a specific circumstance in the view

---

Imperative (Traditional)

```html
<ul class="navigation">
    <li class="item item1 active"><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
    <li class="item item2"><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
    <li class="item item3"><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
</ul>
```
&nbsp;

Declarative (AngularJS)

```javascript
<ul class="navigation">
    <li ng-repeat="item in items"
        class="item"
        ng-class="{'active' : item.id == activeItem}">{{ item.name }}</li>
</ul>

<script>
    $scope.activeItem = 'item1';
    $scope.items = [
        { id: 'item1', name: 'Item 1'},
        { id: 'item2', name: 'Item 2'},
        { id: 'item3', name: 'Item 3'}
    ]
</script>

```

## Don't augment jQuery with AngularJS

- jQuery is javascript **library**

- AngularJS is a client-side **framework**.

- Don't try to replace jQuery patterns with AngularJS. Instead try removing jQuery altogether until you are comfortable with AngularJS.


---

## Don't design your page, and then change it with DOM manipulations

- Think about models, rather than jQuery-selected DOM elements that hold your data. 

- Think about views as projections of those models, rather than registering callbacks to manipulate what the user sees.

- Angular wants you to *declare* how to display a specific circumstance in the view

---

## The wrong way

```javascript
.directive( 'myDirective', function () {
    return {
        template: '<a class="btn">Toggle me!</a>',
        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {
            $(element).click( function () {
                if ( $(element).is('.active') ) {
                    $(element).removeClass( 'active' );
                }
                else {
                    $(element).addClass( 'active' );
                }
            });
        }
    };
});
```
&nbsp;

Before doing DOM manipulation anywhere in your application, ask yourself if you really need to.

---

## The Angular way

```javascript
.directive( 'myDirective', function () {
    return {
        scope: true,
        template: '<a class="btn" ng-class="{active: on}" ng-click="toggle()">' +
                     'Toggle me!' +
                  '</a>',
        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {
            scope.on = false;

            scope.toggle = function () {
                scope.on = !scope.on;
            };
        }
    };
});
```
&nbsp;

The less DOM manipulation, the easier directives are to test, style, and change in the future.

---

## When Your Controllers Get Bigger, Learn Scope

- Many people treat `scope` as magic and don't bother trying to understand it.

- This is where the declarative part of Angular really shines

- But as your apps get more complex you will start to uncounter unexpected behaviour like the following:

&nbsp;

```javascript
function SomeCtrl($scope) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        $scope.message = "I am here!";
    }, 1000);
}
```

&nbsp;

- When your controllers get big, it’s time to break them into sub controllers. Angular scope is based of javascripts prototypal inheritance. Understanding that, will help you greatly.

---

## Angular.js Router Might Not Be What You Expected

- Angular.js router has a very specific usage. 

- ex. Backbone.js or Ember.js router monitors the `location.hash' and calls a function when matched.

- Angular.js instead works like server-side router: it is built to work with `ng-view`.

- A route is hit, a template is loaded, injected into ng-view and a controller instantiated.

- If you need different behaviour, create a custom service.

# Summary

AngularJS is awesome :)

But has a frustrating learning curve.

The model should dictate your views

Think about how you would do it in jQuery... and then don't do that.
